ðŸ“– Project Overview

Data is rarely clean when collected. It often comes with missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formats that can mislead analysis and decision-making.

This project focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning using Python (Pandas & NumPy) to transform raw datasets into structured, reliable, and analysis-ready data.

ðŸ”Ž Problem Statement

Raw datasets are often messy, containing missing values, duplicates, and irregular formatting. Without cleaning, any analysis or machine learning model will produce inaccurate or misleading insights.

📖 Project Overview

Data is rarely clean when collected. It often comes with missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formats that can mislead analysis and decision-making.

This project focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning using Python (Pandas & NumPy) to transform raw datasets into structured, reliable, and analysis-ready data.

🔎 Problem Statement

Raw datasets are often messy, containing missing values, duplicates, and irregular formatting. Without cleaning, any analysis or machine learning model will produce inaccurate or misleading insights.

🛠️ Approach & Methodology

I followed a step-by-step approach to clean the dataset:

1. Data Loading

• Imported the dataset using Pandas.

• Conducted an initial exploration to understand the structure.

2. Handling Missing Values

• Identified missing data.

• Applied methods like dropna(), fillna(), and forward/backward fill depending on the context.

3. Removing Duplicates

• Checked for duplicates using df.duplicated().

• Removed them with df.drop_duplicates().

4. Data Transformation

• Standardized column formats (date, strings, numeric values).

• Renamed inconsistent column names for clarity.

5. Final Dataset

• Produced a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis, visualization, or feeding into ML models.

⚙️ Technologies Used

   • Python 🐍

   • Pandas for data manipulation

   • NumPy for numerical computations

   • Jupyter Notebook for exploration & visualization

📊 Key Learnings

• Importance of data cleaning before analysis.

• Hands-on experience with missing value imputation, outlier handling, and data transformation.

• Strengthened understanding of Pandas & NumPy operations.

🚀 Future Improvements

• Automating the cleaning process with reusable functions.

• Adding visualizations for outlier detection.

• Creating a pipeline for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.

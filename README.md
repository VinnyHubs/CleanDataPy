📖 Project Overview

Data is rarely clean when collected. It often comes with missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formats that can mislead analysis and decision-making.

This project focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning using Python (Pandas & NumPy) to transform raw datasets into structured, reliable, and analysis-ready data.

🔎 Problem Statement

Raw datasets are often messy, containing missing values, duplicates, and irregular formatting. Without cleaning, any analysis or machine learning model will produce inaccurate or misleading insights.

🛠️ Approach & Methodology

I followed a step-by-step approach to clean the dataset:

1.Data Loading

-Imported the dataset using Pandas.

-Conducted an initial exploration to understand the structure.

2.Handling Missing Values

-Identified missing data.

-Applied methods like dropna(), fillna(), and forward/backward fill depending on the context.

3.Removing Duplicates

-Checked for duplicates using df.duplicated().

-Removed them with df.drop_duplicates().

4.Data Transformation

-Standardized column formats (date, strings, numeric values).

-Renamed inconsistent column names for clarity.

5.Final Dataset

-Produced a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis, visualization, or feeding into ML models.
